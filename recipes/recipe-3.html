                Sending off your relatives to school or work with a bento box — a Japanese-style 
                packed lunch of rice, meat, and vegetables — is a common practice in Japan. More 
                than the nourishment they provide, these lunchtime meals show that you care for 
                the person. In "My Neighbour Totoro", for instance, Satsuki often prepares bento 
                boxes for her father and her sister Mei. For your own bento box, you can be as 
                creative as you like, shaping the rice into cute shapes and sizes as well.
